This describes changes that need to be made to container_management/backend/model/mixins/serialize_extra_container_values.rb
Once the container management plugin is integrated into the core code, these changes could presumably be made to the bhl_ead_exporter


1. Do not export parent or id attributes
2. Export altrender as a type attribute for n == 1
3. Export type_n.downcase as a type attribute for n == 2 and n == 3
4. Export type_n as a label attribute for n == 2 and n == 3
