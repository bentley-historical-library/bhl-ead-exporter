    "University records are public records and once fully processed are generally open to research use. Records that contain personally identifiable information will be restricted in order to protect individual privacy. Certain administrative records are restricted in accordance with university policy as outlined below. The restriction of university records is subject to compliance with applicable laws, including the Michigan Freedom of Information Act."

  def self.sr_restrictions
    '<emph render="bold">Student educational records</emph>: FERPA\'s protection of personally identifiable information in a student\'s education records ends at the time of a student\'s death and therefore is a matter of institutional policy.  As a courtesy to the families of recently deceased students who were enrolled at the time of death, the University generally will not release information from their education records for five years without the consent of the deceased student\'s next of kin. Eighty-five (85) years after the date the records were first created, the University will presume that the student is deceased. Thereafter the student\'s education records will be open.  Student records at the Bentley Historical Library are restricted for eighty-five (85) years, but may also be made available upon proof of the death of the student.'
